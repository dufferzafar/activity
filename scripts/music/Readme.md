# Music

I've been using YouTube Music for quite a while now.

I used to use a Scrobbling app that would send listen history to Last.fm: https://www.last.fm/user/dufferZafar

But no such app exists on iOS, so my recent last.fm history is incomplete.

On my laptop, I still use Web Scrobbler extension to send listen history to Last.fm: https://github.com/web-scrobbler/web-scrobbler

## todos

* Fetch listen history from Last.fm
* Merge with YouTube Music data
